# K-Means with equal size variation for clustering interferencing links
# This is inspired by: https://elki-project.github.io/tutorial/same-size_k_means, but with simplification
# To ensure the viability of using K-Means, gonna simply use the mid-point of each transceiver pair as the representative point of the link
